# How to sync

To sync the content up to live:

Install the AWS CLI tools, available at:

    https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

Get the super secret access credentials. They are not below, you'll have
to get them from somewhere else and then execute the following:

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=secret
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secreter

And then run:

    ./bin/sync.sh

#bossmode
